 *  TODO https://github.com/retronym/scala/compare/topic/closure-sharing
 *       Why not constrain isSafeToUseConstantFunction to just Function whose apply()'s body has constant type?
 *       Useful e.g. with assert(cond, msg) when msg is string literal
 *       (otherwise, the anon-closure-class refers to the enclosing method, which refers to inner classes chain, not to mention the ConstantPool grows, etc.)
