     *   (a) checking whether inlining is feasible. If unfeasible, don't touch anything and return false.
     *   (b) replacing the callsite with:
     *       STORE instructions for expected arguments,
     *       callee instructions adapted to their new environment
     *         (accesses to local-vars shifted,
     *          RETURNs replaced by jumps to the single-exit of the inlined instructions,
     *          without forgetting to empty all the stack slots except stack-top right before jumping to that single-exit)
     *   (c) copying the debug info from the callee's over to the host method
     *   (d) re-computing the maxLocals and maxStack of the host method.
     *   (e) return None (this indicates success).
     *
     * Inlining is considered unfeasible in four cases, summarized below and described in more detail on the spot:
     *   (a.0) callee is a synchronized method
     *   (a.1) due to the possibility of the callee clearing the operand-stack when entering an exception-handler
     *   (a.2) inlining would lead to illegal access errors.
     *   (a.3) calee returns scala.runtime.Nothing$ , which means it'll throw an exception
     *         (s.r.Nothing$ looks like an object to the type-flow analysis).

    /*
     * This method inlines the invocation of a "higher-order method" and
     * stack-allocates the anonymous closures received as arguments.
     *
     * "Stack-allocating" in the sense of "scalar replacement of aggregates" (see also "object fusion").
     * This can always be done for closures converted in UnCurry via `closureConversionModern()`
     * a conversion that has the added benefit of minimizing pointer-chasing (heap navigation).
     *
     *
     * Rationale
     * ---------
     *
     * Closure inlining results in faster code by specializing a higher-order method
     * to the particular anonymous closures given as arguments at a particular callsite
     * (at the cost of code duplication, namely of the Hi-O method, no other code gets duplicated).
     *
     * The "Hi-O" method usually applies the closure inside a loop (e.g., map and filter fit this description)
     * that's why a hi-O callsite can be regarded for most practical purposes as a loop-header.
     * "Regarded as a loop header" because we'd like the JIT compiler to pick that code section for compilation.
     * If actually a loop-header, and the instructions for the hi-O method were inlined,
     * then upon OnStackReplacement the whole method containing the hi-O invocation would have to be compiled
     * (which might well not be hot code itself).
     *
     * To minimize that wasted effort, `inlineClosures()` creates a dedicated (static, synthetic) method
     * for a given combination of hi-O and closures to inline
     * (not all closures might be amenable to inlining, details below).
     * In that method, closure-apply() invocations are inlined, thus cancelling out:
     *   - any redundant box-unbox pairs when passing arguments to closure-apply(); as well as
     *   - any unbox-box pair for its return value.
     *
     *
     * Terminology
     * -----------
     *
     * hi-O method:     the "higher-order" method taking one or more closure instances as argument. For example, Range.foreach()
     *
     * closure-state:   the values of fields of an anonymous-closure-class, all of them final.
     *                  In particular an $outer field is present whenever the closure "contains" inner classes (in particular, closures).
     *
     * closure-methods: apply() which possibly forwards to a specialized variant after unboxing some of its arguments.
     *                  For a closure converted in UnCurry:
     *                    - via `closureConversionModern()` there are no additional closure-methods.
     *                    - via `closureConversionTraditional()`  those methods that were local to the source-level apply()
     *                      also become closure-methods after lambdalift.
     *
     * closure-constructor: a sequence of assignments to initialize the (from then on immutable) closure-state by copying arguments' values.
     *                      The first such argument is always the THIS of the invoker,
     *                      which becomes the $outer value from the perspective of the closure-class.
     *
     *
     * Preconditions
     * -------------
     *
     * In order to stack-allocate a particular closure passed to Hi-O,
     * the closure in question should not escape from Hi-O (a necessary condition).
     * There's in fact a whole cascade of prerequisites to check,
     * desribed in detail in helper methods `survivors1()` to `survivors3()`,
     * with some yet more pre-conditions being check in `ClosureClassUtil.isRepOK()`.
     *
     * Rewriting mechanics
     * -------------------
     *
     * Provided all pre-conditions have been satisfied, `StaticHiOUtil.buildStaticHiO()` is tasked with
     * preparing a MethodNode that will be invoked instead of hi-O. That method is the last one to have veto power.
     * If successful, it only remains for `StaticHiOUtil.rewriteHost()` to patch `host` to change the target of
     * the original callsite invocation, as well as adapt its arguments.
     *
     * @param hostOwner        the class declaring the host method.
     *                         Upon successful closure-inling, a "static-HiO" ("shio") method is added to hostOwner.
     * @param host             the method containing a callsite for which inlining has been requested
     * @param callsiteTypeFlow the type-stack reaching the callsite. Useful for knowing which args are closure-typed.
     * @param inlineTarget     inlining request (includes: callsite, callee, callee's owner, and error reporting)
     *
     * @return Some(detailedMessage) iff inlining was actually performed, None otherwise.

       *  This utility method returns a fabricated MethodNode, where invocation chains as above have been
       *  collapsed into a self-contained method. In case this is not possible,
       *  this method returns a scala.Util.Left reporting the reason for unfeasibility as a String.
       *
       *  For example, this method returns `Left` for a closure converted by `closureConversionTraditional()`

       *  closure-methods. In general it's not always possible to "un-do" all the dependencies on the closure's THIS,
       *  and in the example we don't even try.
       *
       *  Starting from the known `applyMethod`, collapsing involves:
       *    (i)  checking whether THIS doesn't escape. If so, the current method is fine as is.
       *    (ii) in case THIS escapes only as receiver of a (non-recursive) invocation on this closure,
       *         then drill-down into the target. If that target can itself be collapsed,
       *         we collapse it with the current method being visited (as expected,

       *     (at the cost of code duplication, namely of the Hi-O method, no other code gets duplicated).
       *
       *  The MethodNode built by `buildStaticHiO()` is the "specialized code" referred to above.
       *  The main difficulty is properly shifting local-var-indexes, so that they keep denoting the same values.
       *  Shifting is needed because:
       *    - some formal params have been removed (those for closure-instances), while
       *    - others (zero or more closure-state values) have taken their place, and also because
       *    - the code snippets pasted to replace closure-invocations use local-vars of their own.
       *
       *  The steps to build `staticHiO` are:
       *
       *    (1) pick unique method name
       *
       *    (2) visit `hiO` formal params,
       *        discarding those for stack-allocated closures, and
       *        splicing-in params for closure-state.
       *        Along the way staticHiO's maxLocals is updated. Its initial value was hiO's maxLocals.
       *
       *    (3) now comes putting together the body of staticHiO.
       *        The starting point is a verbatim copy of hiO's InsnList,
       *        ie source-line information will be present (if any).
       *        The exception-handlers table can be copied without changes,
       *        while the entries about visibility ranges of local-vars need shifting.
       *
       *    (4) Those closure-applications still present in the method body can't remain forever.
       *        The contract with `getStubsIterator()` is:
       *            for each closure to inline, give me an iterator of code snippets,
       *            where each code snippet has to be able to cope with the arguments (save for the receiver)
       *            of a usage of that closure (ie of a closure-application).
       *
       *  @return `staticHiO` if preconditions are satisfied. Otherwise null.

       * --------------------------------
       *
       *   (a) The NEW, DUP, and < init > instructions for closure instantiation have been removed.
       *   (b) INVOKE Hi-O has been replaced by INVOKE shio,
       *       which expects on the operand stack not closures but their closure-state instead.
       *       The closure-state of a closure may consist of zero, one, or more arguments

       *  The invoker of this method, `buildStaticHiO()`, will have an easier time if it just can replace
       *  those invocations without touching the instructions surrounding them.
       *
       *  To make that possible, this method returns copies (as many as closure usages) of a stub of instructions.
       *  The stub takes as starting point `stubTemplate` (a MethodNode where chains of apply-invocations
       *  have been collapsed into a self-contained method).
       *
       *  The stub is obtained by:
       *    (1) prefixing STORE instructions (whose locals are added here too) to consume the actual arguments
       *        the closure-usage used to consume.
       *    (2) reformulating GETFIELDs on closure-state, to use instead the spliced-in params in staticHiO
       *        (these params receive values that used to go to the closure's constructor)
       *    (3) properly shifting locals so that the resulting stub makes sense.
